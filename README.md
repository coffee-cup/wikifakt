# wikifakt

Generate a random fact from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). All facts will be short, 1-3 sentences long. This api also allows you to get a random Wikipedia article title. [faktbot.xyz](https://faktbot.xyz) is a preview website of the library with the associated code found [here](https://github.com/coffee-cup/wikibot-website)

## Examples

#### Random facts

## Installation

```
npm i --save wikifakt
```

## Usage

WikiFakt exposes two functions which return promises.

- `getRandomFact`
- `getRandomRandomArticleTitle`

```javascript
var WikiFakt = require('wikifakt');

// Get a fact
WikiFakt.getRandomFact().then(function(fact) {
  console.log(fact);
});

// Get an article title
WikiFakt.getRandomArticleTitle().then(function(title) {
  console.log(title);
});
```

### Preloading

Getting facts requires making two HTTP GET requests _(one to get the random Wikipedia article, and a second to the Wikipedia api to get the content)_. Because of this, WikiFakt, by default, will preload facts. The first call to `getRandomFact` will actually fetch two facts and store the second for later use. Subsequent calls to `getRandomFact` will immediatly return the preloaded fact without needing to make any HTTP requests. In the background, _after the fact has already been returned_, a new fact will be fetched and preloaded. This will speed up getting facts from the API if you expect to be using it multiple times.

Preloading can be disabled with

```javascript
WikiFakt.preload = false;
```
